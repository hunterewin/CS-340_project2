While this can be very difficult to do, it is something that has to be done. Writing code while trying to maintain it, can be very difficult and almost feel like you are all over the place. The best advice I have ever been given is to test early, and test often. This prevents many errors later on down the road. This in turn will assist in keeping the code readable and adaptable. 

I approach a problem as a scientist by first determining what the problem is, and why it happened. After establishing the problem, I would start developing a solution. Once I have a solution or a solution thought, I would attempt to implement it. Once I have tested the implementation and received the results, I can then decide how to resolve the problem, and keep it from happening again.

It matters what the scientists to simply because it gives the end user the best experience possible. If they don't do their job, not only will noone install/download the application, it will have many issues and drive people away from using it. It is also most important to keep the website/application secure. Anyone that downloads the application or uses the website, personal information is then stored, and has to be protected. If that information would be compromised, this then would drive away business and keepy people from wanting to use the application.
